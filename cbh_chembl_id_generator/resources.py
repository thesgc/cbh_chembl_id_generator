        Updates a collection in-place.
        The exact behavior of ``PATCH`` to a list resource is still the matter of
        some debate in REST circles, and the ``PATCH`` RFC isn't standard. So the
        behavior this method implements (described below) is something of a
        stab in the dark. It's mostly cribbed from GData, with a smattering
        of ActiveResource-isms and maybe even an original idea or two.
        The ``PATCH`` format is one that's similar to the response returned from
        a ``GET`` on a list resource::
            {
              "objects": [{object}, {object}, ...],
              "deleted_objects": ["URI", "URI", "URI", ...],
            }
        For each object in ``objects``:
            * If the dict does not have a ``resource_uri`` key then the item is
              considered "new" and is handled like a ``POST`` to the resource list.
            * If the dict has a ``resource_uri`` key and the ``resource_uri`` refers
              to an existing resource then the item is a update; it's treated
              like a ``PATCH`` to the corresponding resource detail.
            * If the dict has a ``resource_uri`` but the resource *doesn't* exist,
              then this is considered to be a create-via-``PUT``.
        Each entry in ``deleted_objects`` referes to a resource URI of an existing
        resource to be deleted; each is handled like a ``DELETE`` to the relevent
        resource.
        In any case:
            * If there's a resource URI it *must* refer to a resource of this
              type. It's an error to include a URI of a different resource.
            * ``PATCH`` is all or nothing. If a single sub-operation fails, the
              entire request will fail and all resources will be rolled back.
          * For ``PATCH`` to work, you **must** have ``put`` in your
            :ref:`detail-allowed-methods` setting.
          * To delete objects via ``deleted_objects`` in a ``PATCH`` request you
            **must** have ``delete`` in your :ref:`detail-allowed-methods`
            setting.
        Substitute appropriate names for ``objects`` and
        ``deleted_objects`` if ``Meta.collection_name`` is set to something
        other than ``objects`` (default).
